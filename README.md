# Overview

Marzneshin is a censorship circumvention tool utilizing other censorship circumvention tools.

Dashboard enables access to nodes(configurations, status and stats, logs),
hosts, users, service entities; while providing monitoring and system statistics.

On the other hand, the backend manages nodes, users, users' subscriptions, etc.

Marzneshin controls the [Marznodes](https://github.com/khodedawsh/marznode)
connected to it; monitoring/disabling/enabling users on marznode instances while
marznode manages and interacts with vpn backends (such as xray).

### Features

- **Web UI** Dashboard
- **Multi Nodes** support for traffic distribution, scalability, and fault tolerance
- Supports protocols **Vmess**, **VLESS**, **Trojan** and **Shadowsocks** as provided by xray
- **Multi-protocol** for a single user
- Manage users' access to inbounds separately using **services**
- **Multi-user** on a single inbound
- Limit users' data and set exire dates
- Reset traffic periodically (daily, weekly,...)
- **Subscription link** compatible with **V2ray** (e.g. V2RayNG, OneClick, Nekoray, etc.), **Clash** and **ClashMeta**
- Automated **Share link** and **QRcode** generator
- System, nodes, traffic statistics, users monitoring
- Integrated **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- [**Multi-admin** support](https://github.com/khodedawsh/marzneshin/issues/73) (WIP)
- Marzneshin is decoupled from VPN backends
- Resilient and fault tolerant node management

**Deployment and Developer Kit:**

- REST-full API
- Kubernetes and multiple deployment strategy and options (WIP)

### Supported Languages

# Installation guide

Run the following command

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/khodedawsh/Marzneshin/raw/master/script.sh)" @ install
```

To install with mariadb:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/khodedawsh/Marzneshin/raw/master/script.sh)" @ install --database mariadb
```

You could also use mysql by writing mysql instead, however mariadb is **recommended**.
Also to install the latest nightly release use the `--nightly` option.

Once the installation is complete:

- You'd notice the logs, which you could stop watching by pressing `Ctrl+C`; The process will continue running normally.
- the configuration file can be found at `/etc/opt/marzneshin/.env` (refer to [configurations](#configuration) section
  to see variables)
- Data files will be placed at `/var/lib/marzneshin`; e.g. the sqlite database.
- You can access the Marzneshin dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating
  to `http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/dashboard/`

Next, you need to create a sudo admin for logging into the Marzneshin dashboard by the following command

```bash
marzneshin cli admin create --sudo
```

That's it! You can login to your dashboard using these credentials

To see the help message of the Marzneshin script, run the following command

```bash
marzneshin --help
```

If you are eager to run the project using the source code, check the section below
<details markdown="1">
<summary><h3>Manual install (advanced)</h3></summary>


Clone this project and install the dependencies (you'd need Python >= 3.10)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khodedawsh/Marzneshin
cd Marzneshin/
wget -qO- https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, to have an isolated environment you can use [Python Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

To install dashboard dependencies and build the dashboard:

```bash
make dashboard-deps
make dashboard-build
```

note that you'll need pnpm and npm installed.

If you want to use `marzneshin-cli`, you should link it to a file in your `$PATH`, make it executable, and install the
auto-completion:

```bash
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/marzneshin-cli.py /usr/bin/marzneshin-cli
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/marzneshin-cli
marzneshin-cli completion install
```

Now it's time to configuration

Make a copy of `.env.example` file, take a look and edit it using a text editor like `nano`.

You probably like to modify the admin credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

> Check [configurations](#configuration) section for more information

Eventually, launch the application using command below

```bash
make start
```

To launch with linux systemctl (copy marzneshin.service file to `/var/lib/marzneshin/marzneshin.service`)

```
systemctl enable /var/lib/marzneshin/marzneshin.service
systemctl start marzneshin
```

To use with nginx

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location ~* /(dashboard|static|locales|api|docs|redoc|openapi.json) {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    # xray-core ws-path: /
    # client ws-path: /marzneshin/me/2087
    #
    # All traffic is proxed through port 443, and send to the xray port(2087, 2088 etc.).
    # The '/marzneshin' in location regex path can changed any characters by yourself.
    #
    # /${path}/${username}/${xray-port}
    location ~* /marzneshin/.+/(.+)$ {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:$1/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

or

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  marzneshin.example.com;

    ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

By default the app will be run on `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`. You can configure it using changing
the `UVICORN_HOST` and `UVICORN_PORT` environment variables.

# API

Marzneshin provides a REST API that enables developers to interact with Marzneshin services programmatically. To view
the API documentation in Swagger UI or ReDoc, set the configuration variable `DOCS=True` and navigate to the `/docs`
and `/redoc`.

# Backup

It's always a good idea to backup your Marzneshin files regularly to prevent data loss in case of system failures or
accidental deletion. Here are the steps to backup Marzneshin:

1. By default, all Marzneshin important files are saved in `/var/lib/marzneshin` (Docker versions). Copy the
   entire `/var/lib/marzneshin` directory to a backup location of your choice, such as an external hard drive or cloud
   storage.
2. Additionally, make sure to backup your env file, which contains your configuration variables. If you installed
   Marzneshin using the script (recommended installation approach), the env and other configurations should be
   inside `/etc/opt/marzneshin/` directory.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you have a backup of all your Marzneshin files and data, as well as your
configuration variables and Xray configuration, in case you need to restore them in the future. Remember to update your
backups regularly to keep them up-to-date.

# Telegram Bot

Marzneshin comes with an integrated Telegram bot that can handle server management, user creation and removal, and send
notifications. This bot can be easily enabled by following a few simple steps, and it provides a convenient way to
interact with Marzneshin without having to log in to the server every time.

To enable Telegram Bot:

1. set `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` to your bot's API Token
2. set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID` to your Telegram account's numeric ID, you can get your ID
   from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

# Marzneshin CLI

Marzneshin comes with an integrated CLI named `marzneshin-cli` which allows administrators to have direct interaction
with it.

If you've installed Marzneshin using the installation script, you can access the cli commands by running

```bash
marzneshin cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

For more information, You can read [Marzneshin CLI's documentation](./cli/README.md).

# marznode

[marznode](https://github.com/khodedawsh/marznode) is the backend needed to run proxy servers.

# Webhook notifications

You can set a webhook address and Marzneshin will send the notifications to that address.

the requests will be sent as a post request to the address provided by `WEBHOOK_ADDRESS` with `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
as `x-webhook-secret` in the headers.

Example request sent from Marzneshin:

```
Headers:
Host: 0.0.0.0:9000
User-Agent: python-requests/2.28.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
x-webhook-secret: something-very-very-secret
Content-Length: 107
Content-Type: application/json



Body:
{"username": "marzneshin_test_user", "action": "user_updated", "enqueued_at": 1680506457.636369, "tries": 0}
```

Different action typs
are: `user_created`, `user_updated`, `user_deleted`, `user_limited`, `user_expired`, `user_disabled`, `user_enabled`
